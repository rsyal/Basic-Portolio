        <p class="writing">
            Here goes information about me. I was born in India. I came to MN when I was 4. Therefore I can truly call myself a "Minnesota".
            I grew up in NE Mpls when it was a dumb. (Now it's the cultural hub). I went to college, then medical school,
            then off of to work. In between all of this, I got married, had 3 kids. I like to sleep, hike, hang out with
            friends, eat at new places unbeknownst to the world. When I grow up, I want to live in a place that is surrounded
            by mountains.
