            Here goes information about me. I was born in India. I came to MN
            when I was 4. Therefore I can truly call myself a "Minnesota".
            I grew up in NE Mpls when it was a dumb. (Now it's the cultural hub).
            I went to college, then medical school, then off of to work. In 
            between all of this, I got married, had 3 kids. I like to sleep, hike,
            hang out with friends, eat at new places unbeknownst to the world. 
            When I grow up, I want to live in a place that is surrounded by mountains.
