My Portfolio

In this assignment, I built my portfolio using HTML/CSS. It will include a front page, a contact page, and a page to display all of my projects. 

I created a repository in GitHub with the following tree:

├── assets
|  ├── css
|  |  ├── reset.css
|  |  └── style.css
|  └── images
├── contact.html
├── index.html
└── portfolio.html

### Additional Specifcations

1. Colors:
 [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages._
   * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
   * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
   * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   * Footer background color: `#666666`
   * Main content background color: `#ffffff`
   * Main content border color: `#dddddd`

2. Fonts:
   * For heading, fonts used `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;`.
   * For all other fonts used `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:
   * A picture of me.

4. Portfolio Images:
   * Placeholder images found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). 

5. Background Images:
   * The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). 

6. Dimensions:
   * The entire content and the main section content area is `960px` wide.
   * Pro-tip: Use the [Page Ruler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en) extension to measure the size of elements.

### Bonus

1. Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be found [here](http://www.codeitpretty.com/2013/06/how-to-use-css-hover-effects.html). 

2. You can use [Adobe Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal `#4aaaa5`).

3. Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
   * Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found [here](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/). 


* Don't forget to look into these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.
